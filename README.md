# arzg’s LaTeX configuration – The `argon` LaTeX class + pandoc 
templates

The `argon` class is designed to be used both for reports and 
articles. 

At the moment, this entire project has not been optimised for 
general use, and has settings and options that are completely 
specific to my usage. An example of this is the `presentation.tex` 
file in the `pandoc` directory; it is unrelated to this project, 
but is included anyway because this repo is for my LaTeX 
configuration.

It is recommended that you do **not** use this class – this 
repository is meant for version control only. It is also 
recommended that you only use this class with the included pandoc 
templates; not with standalone documents. It is best to use 
`latexmk -pdf` for compilation instead of the pandoc compiler.

For anyone using this project in conjunction with `vim` and 
TeXShop, a few handy scripts can be found in [my 
dotfiles](https://github.com/arzg/dotfiles).
