# The Argon LaTeX class

This class is designed to be used both for reports and articles. 

It is recommended that you do **not** use this class -- this 
repository is meant for version control only. It is also 
recommended that you only use this class with the included pandoc 
templates; not with standalone documents. It is best to use 
`latexmk -pdf` for compilation instead of the pandoc compiler.

For anyone using this project in conjunction with `vim` and 
TeXShop, a few handy scripts can be found in [my 
dotfiles](https://github.com/aramisgithub/dotfiles).
